The Phylogenetics of the eye is said that we see all reflectulated light but green, the skiology of the gene H2F7B09 is double to that of soilogitis stein. 


Genetic cross over to the isoulation of ebony and eborneic stein is said to form an cross erectic parasite. 

The skin will change coulour with ebony and green based tanned but if you add a sight indictor like ejduritopic solution the skin will (on theory) cAause an obuse angleriour ofsidnious order.

So I would add an isotiopic conpond like zink and moristiopoius pro-oxide like mxnocibajufitous ( I tried to link the medical). Which would stop the change in colour but it is said that the patient would reject the and probably suffer breathing and breeding problems. So speaking, you need to somehow change the chemical aragan of the two?

I would slip and toss and then cut the gene which would apppear to be orhfuis and cross indeed it with aglaie.
